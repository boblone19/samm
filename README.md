## SAMM Sponsors

We thank our sponsors for their OWASP SAMM support. All proceeds from the
sponsorship support the mission of the OWASP Foundation and the further
development of SAMM. Supporting the project drives the funding for
research grants, SAMM hosting, tools, templates, documents, promotion,
and more.

By sponsoring SAMM, you not only support an important and flagship OWASP
project, you will also get visibility during the next SAMM User Conference 
and recognition on the OWASP SAMM [web site](https://owaspsamm.org/) and
