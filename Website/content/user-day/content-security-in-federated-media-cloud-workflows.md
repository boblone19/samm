    Content security is a major issue for film and TV studios around the world, the Trusted Partner Network has developed a common set of security controls and best practices led by the Hollywood studios and global VOD platforms to reduce audit cost and ensure consistency across vendors in the supply chain. This session looks at the evolution of the control framework to incorporate cloud workflows with a novel approach that maps against existing standards such as OWASP ASVS,  best practice secure configuration guidelines published by the leading cloud platforms and new threats tracked by the Media & Entertainment ISAC to create a template for managing security risks that can be easily embedded in the delivery and development process.
