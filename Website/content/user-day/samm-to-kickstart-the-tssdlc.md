abstract: |
    Thomas talks about his experiences applying OWASP SAMM at different companies and discusses typical pitfalls to avoid when implementing security activities in the software development life-cycle. Aiming for a consistent maturity level across all security functions may seem appealing on paper, but in practice a more nuanced approach will help you ramping up your security posture much faster. Thomas will discuss how to use your security requirements as the backbone of secure software development and why enabling security champions is a great starting point to kickstart your SSDLC.
