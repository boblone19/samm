    Like many other organizations, I have tried and implemented SAMM in my organization(multiple projects). However, it was always challenging for me to conduct interviews to access all the different business functions and security practices and make my team understand the SAMM model. I found it very difficult to circulate the SAMM sheet across different business functions and get them up to speed on showcasing the maturity results. We know that the SAMM version 2.0 has worked further on the scoring model to represent the additional assurance in presence beyond the maturity level it belongs to. To ensure organization could gain proper credit for their effort in software security, I have created SAMM web version and offered the granular scoring dashboards with maturity scores that represent different levels of maturity with this maturity dashboard it will be easy for anyone to setup SAMM web version and create multiple users as per their business needs and generate different formats of the report which will very help full in building strategy to collect metrics defining organization’s security posture.
